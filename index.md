Hi! I'm Maddie, an astrophysicist from Tasmania, Australia. I study the host galaxies of supermassive black holes in the early Universe using computer simulations and space telescopes.
I have just completed my PhD at the University of Melbourne, and am beginning a new position as the Plaskett Fellow at the National Research Council Canada, Herzberg Astronomy and Astrophysics, in October 2020.
