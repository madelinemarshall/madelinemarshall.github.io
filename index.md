  Hi! I'm Maddie, an astrophysicist from Tasmania, Australia. I study the host galaxies of supermassive black holes in the early Universe using computer simulations and space telescopes.
  I have just completed my PhD at the University of Melbourne, and am beginning a new position as the Plaskett Fellow at the National Research Council Canada, Herzberg Astronomy and Astrophysics.

  My work was recently featured by a NASA/STSci press release, which you can read [here](https://www.nasa.gov/feature/goddard/2020/simulations-show-webb-telescope-can-reveal-distant-galaxies-hidden-in-quasars-glare/)!
