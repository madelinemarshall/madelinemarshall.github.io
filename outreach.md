Read an overview of my most recent work simulating high-redshift quasar host galaxies and find out why we're so optimistic about JWST in this nice <a href="https://physics.aps.org/articles/v15/24">Physics magazine article</a>.
For a full update on JWST and the science it can do, check out my interview on the science podcast
