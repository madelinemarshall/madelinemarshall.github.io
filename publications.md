## Observations of High-Redshift Quasars <br>

**JWST's PEARLS: A z=6 Quasar in a Train-Wreck Galaxy Merger System**<br>
[arxiv: 2502.20550](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20550)<br>


As part of the PEARLS GTO program, we observed the z=5.89 quasar NDWFS J1425+3254 with JWST NIRSpec integral field spectroscopy (IFS). 
We find that the quasar host has significant ongoing obscured star formation, as well as possibly one of the most extreme quasar-driven outflows in the early Universe. 
We find that two companion galaxies are merging with the quasar host, with a connecting bridge of gas between one companion and the quasar providing smoking-gun evidence for the ongoing interaction.
The system is a "train-wreck" merger of three galaxies, with star formation and extreme quasar activity that were likely triggered by these ongoing interactions.

**GA-NIFS & EIGER: A merging quasar host at z=7 with an overmassive black hole**<br>
[arxiv: 2402.17163](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17163)<br>
We combined JWST observations from the GA-NIFS (IFS) and EIGER (imaging) teams to study the z=7.08 quasar J1120+0641, giving the most comprehensive understanding of a high-z quasar host galaxy with JWST to date.
We find that the quasar host is undergoing a merger with a bright companion galaxy. This alters the stellar mass measurements, which were previously overestimated due to the presence of this companion, and lack of emission line measurements. Now, we measure an extreme black hole-stellar mass ratio of ~50%, the most overmassive black hole ever discovered.


**Black hole and host galaxy properties of two z ≃ 6.8 quasars from the NIRSpec IFU**<br>
[DOI: 10.1051/0004-6361/202346113](https://doi.org/10.1051/0004-6361/202346113) [arxiv: 2302.04795](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.04795)<br>
This work highlights the exceptional capabilities of the JWST NIRSpec IFU for observing quasars in the early Universe, presenting data for our first GA-NIFS quasars, DELS J0411–0907 at z = 6.82 and VDES J0020–3653 at z = 6.86.
We measure black hole masses, discover multple merging companion galaxies, study ionized gas outflows, and more.

**Limits to Rest-Frame Ultraviolet Emission From Far-Infrared-Luminous z~6 Quasar Hosts.**<br>
[DOI:10.3847/1538-4357/abaa4c](https://doi.org/10.3847/1538-4357/abaa4c), [arXiv:2007.13859](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.13859)<br>
We use observations from HST to obtain deep upper limits on the rest-frame ultraviolet luminosities of six z=6 quasars. We discover up to 9 potential
companion galaxies surrounding these quasars, which may be interacting with their host galaxies. Two of these potential companions around NDWFS J1425+3254 have since been spectroscopically confirmed with our JWST data.


## The BlueTides Hydrodynamical Simulation<br>
Using the BlueTides cosmological hydrodynamical simulation, I have studied a range of properties of high-z galaxies and quasars.

In **"The host galaxies of z=7 quasars: predictions from the BlueTides simulation"** [DOI: 10.1093/mnras/staa2982](https://doi.org/10.1093/mnras/staa2982), [arXiv:1912.03428](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.03428), we studied the physical properties of z=7 quasar host galaxies within the simulation, such as their stellar masses, morphologies, sizes, and their location on the black hole–stellar mass relation.
We then made explicit predictions for whether JWST could successfully detect these host galaxies in
**"Observing the host galaxies of high-redshift quasars with JWST: predictions from the BlueTides simulation"** [DOI: 10.1093/mnras/stab1763](https://doi.org/10.1093/mnras/stab1763) [arXiv:2101.01219](https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.01219), by creating mock images and then performing the observational quasar-subtraction techniques.
We predicted that quasar subtraction will be challenging, however a reasonable fraction of quasar host galaxies should be detectable with JWST NIRCam. This has indeed been the case observationally.

I then began to focus on the properties of high-z galaxies.
In **"The Impact of Dust on the Sizes of Galaxies in the Epoch of Reionization"**<br> [DOI: 10.1093/mnras/stac380](https://doi.org/10.1093/mnras/stac380) [arXiv:2110.12075](https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.12075) we studied the sizes of galaxies in BlueTides.
We found that dust is the predominant cause of the observed positive size–luminosity relation, and that this relation varies with wavelength across the rest-frame ultraviolet and optical.
With my undergraduate student Katelyn Watts, we created mock images of each BlueTides galaxy with JWST, Hubble, Roman, Euclid, Subaru, and VISTA, across a range of near- and mid-infrared filters. We released these mock images as the BlueTides Mock Image Catalogue, publicly available via the Mikulski Archive for Space Telescopes (MAST) archive at [DOI: 10.17909/er09-4527](https://doi.org/10.17909/er09-4527). Example codes for using this catalogue can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/madelinemarshall/BlueTidesMockImageCatalogue).
From these mock images, we made predictions for the expected number counts of observed high-z galaxies from JWST Cycle 1 surveys, as published in **"The BlueTides Mock Image Catalogue: Simulated observations of high-redshift galaxies and predictions for JWST imaging surveys"**
[DOI: 10.1093/mnras/stac211](https://doi.org/10.1093/mnras/stac2111) [arxiv: 2206.08941](https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.08941).

## The Meraxes Semi-Analytic Model <br>

Meraxes is a semi-analytic model designed to study galaxy formation and evolution. 
I updated the Meraxes model to study the sizes, angular momenta and morphologies of high-z galaxies in **"Dark-ages Reionization and Galaxy Formation Simulation – XVII. Sizes, angular momenta and morphologies of high redshift galaxies"** [10.1093/mnras/stz1810](https://doi.org/10.1093/mnras/stz1810), [arXiv:1904.01619](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.01619).
I also used Meraxes to study the evolution of black holes and their host galaxies from high redshift to the present day in **"Dark-ages reionization and galaxy formation simulation - XVIII. The high-redshift evolution of black holes and their host galaxies"** [DOI:10.1093/mnras/staa936](https://doi.org/10.1093/mnras/staa936), [arXiv:1910.08124](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.08124)
The model predicts no significant evolution in the black hole–host mass relations out to high redshift, with the growth of galaxies and black holes tightly related even in the early Universe. We also examined the
growth mechanisms of black holes in Meraxes, finding that the majority of black hole growth is caused by internal disc instabilities, and not by galaxy mergers.


## Other Projects

**FORECASTOR - II. Simulating Galaxy Surveys with the Cosmological Advanced Survey Telescope for Optical and UV Research**<br>
[DOI: 10.1093/mnras/staf065](https://doi.org/10.1093/mnras/staf065) [arxiv: 2402.17163](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17163)<br>
Our undergraduate student Laurie Amen developed code to make mock imaging for the upcoming CASTOR telescope. We used this code to predict the performance of the planned CASTOR extragalactic surveys.

**Triggering active galactic nuclei in galaxy clusters** <br>
[DOI: 10.1093/mnras/stx2996](https://doi.org/10.1093/mnras/stx2996), [arXiv:1708.05519](https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.05519) <br>
For my honours project, I used the semi-analytic galaxy formation model SAGE to study the triggering of active galactic nuclei (AGN) in galaxy clusters. We predicted that ram pressure is likely to be an important mechanism for triggering star formation and AGN activity in clusters, that has since been seen observationally.

**Methanol absorption in PKS B1830-211 at milliarcsecond scales**<br>
[DOI: 10.1093/mnras/stw3295](https://doi.org/10.1093/mnras/stw3295) <br>
As an undergraduate project, I published Australian Long Baseline Array observations of 12.2-GHz methanol absorption detected in the gravitational lens system PKS B1830−211.
