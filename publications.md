2019, *"The host galaxies of z=7 quasars: predictions from the BlueTides simulation."* [arXiv:1912.03428](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.03428)
> <span style="font-size:0.7em;"> We examine the properties of the host galaxies of z=7 quasars using the large volume, cosmological hydrodynamical simulation BlueTides. We find that the most massive black holes and quasars are hosted by massive galaxies with stellar masses log(M∗/M⊙)=10.8±0.2, and 10.2±0.4, which have a wide range of star formation rates, of 50<sup>+119</sup>−35M⊙/yr and 19<sup>+28</sup><sub>−12</sub>M⊙/yr, respectively. The hosts of the most massive black holes and quasars in BlueTides are generally bulge-dominated, with bulge-to-total mass ratio B/T≃0.85±0.1, however their morphologies are not biased relative to the overall z=7 galaxy sample. We find that the hosts of the most massive black holes and quasars are significantly more compact, with half-mass radii R0.5=0.29<sup>+0.15</sup><sub>−0.10</sub> kpc and 0.28<sup>+0.08</sup><sub>−0.06</sub> kpc respectively, relative to galaxies with similar masses, which have R0.5=0.5<sup>+0.3</sup><sub>−0.2</sub> kpc. We make mock James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) images of these quasars and their host galaxies. We find that distinguishing the host from the quasar emission will be possible but still challenging with JWST, due to the small sizes of quasar hosts. We find that currently observable quasar samples are biased tracers of the intrinsic black hole--stellar mass relations, following a relation that is 0.27 dex higher than that of the full galaxy sample. Finally, we find that black hole hosts are generally quite isolated. However, the most massive black holes are more likely to be found in denser environments than the typical MBH>10<sup>6.5</sup>M⊙ black hole, indicating that minor mergers at least play some role in growing black holes in the early Universe. </span>

 high-redshift evolution of black holes and their host galaxies."*  [arXiv:1910.08124](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.08124)
> <span style="font-size:0.7em;"> Correlations between black holes and their host galaxies provide insight into
what drives black hole-host co-evolution. We use the Meraxes semi-analytic
model to investigate the growth of black holes and their host galaxies from
high redshift to the present day. Our modelling finds no significant evolution
in the black hole-bulge and black hole-total stellar mass relations out to a
redshift of 8. The black hole-total stellar mass relation has similar but
slightly larger scatter than the black hole-bulge relation, with the scatter in
both decreasing with increasing redshift. In our modelling the growth of
galaxies, bulges and black holes are all tightly related, even at the highest
redshifts. We find that black hole growth is dominated by instability-driven or
secular quasar-mode growth and not by merger-driven growth at all redshifts.
Our model also predicts that disc-dominated galaxies lie on the black
hole-total stellar mass relation, but lie offset from the black hole-bulge mass
relation, in agreement with recent observations and hydrodynamical simulations.  </span>

[10.1093/mnras/stz1810](https://doi.org/10.1093/mnras/stz1810), [arXiv:1904.01619](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.01619)

> <span style="font-size:0.7em;"> We study the sizes, angular momenta and morphologies of high-redshift galaxies using an update of the Meraxes semi-analytic galaxy evolution model. Our model successfully reproduces a range of observations from redshifts z=0-10. We find that the effective radius of a galaxy disc scales with UV luminosity as Re∝L<sub>UV</sub><sup>0.33</sup> at z=5-10, and with stellar mass as Re∝M∗<sup>0.24</sup> at z=5 but with a slope that increases at higher redshifts. Our model predicts that the median galaxy size scales with redshift as Re∝(1+z)<sup>−m</sup>, where m=1.98±0.07 for galaxies with (0.3-1)L<sup>∗</sup><sub>z=3</sub> and m=2.15±0.05 for galaxies with (0.12-0.3)L<sup>∗</sup><sub>z=3</sub>. We find that the ratio between stellar and halo specific angular momentum is typically less than one and decreases with halo and stellar mass. This relation shows no redshift dependence, while the relation between specific angular momentum and stellar mass decreases by ∼0.5 dex from z=7 to z=2. Our model reproduces the distribution of local galaxy morphologies, with bulges formed predominantly through galaxy mergers for low-mass galaxies, disc-instabilities for galaxies with M∗≃10<sup>10</sup>-10<sup>11.5</sup>M<sub>⊙</sub>, and major mergers for the most massive galaxies. At high redshifts, we find galaxy morphologies that are predominantly bulge-dominated. </span>

[10.1093/mnras/stx2996](https://doi.org/10.1093/mnras/stx2996), [arXiv:1708.05519](https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.05519)

>  <span style="font-size:0.7em;"> We model the triggering of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) in galaxy clusters using the semi- analytic galaxy formation model SAGE (Croton et al. 2016). We prescribe triggering methods based on the ram pressure galaxies experience as they move throughout the intracluster medium, which is hypothesized to trigger star formation and AGN activity. The clustercentric radius and velocity distribution of the simulated active galaxies produced by these models are compared with that of AGN and galaxies with intense star formation from a sample of low-redshift, relaxed clusters from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. The ram pressure triggering model that best explains the clustercentric radius and velocity distribution of these observed galaxies has AGN and star formation triggered if 2.5×10<sup>−14</sup><P<sub>ram</sub><2.5×10<sup>−13</sup> Pa and P<sub>ram</sub>>2P<sub>internal</sub>; this is consistent with expectations from hydrodynamical simulations of ram-pressure induced star formation. Our results show that ram pressure is likely to be an important mechanism for triggering star formation and AGN activity in clusters.

[10.1093/mnras/stw3295](https://doi.org/10.1093/mnras/stw3295), [arXiv:1612.05847](https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.05847)

> <span style="font-size:0.7em;"> Observations of the frequencies of different rotational transitions of the methanol molecule have provided the most sensitive probe to date for changes in the proton-to-electron mass ratio, over space and time. Using methanol absorption detected in the gravitational lens system PKS B1830-211, changes in the proton-to-electron ratio over the last 7.5 billion years have been constrained to a fractional change less than 1.1e-07. Molecular absorption systems at cosmological distances present the best opportunity for constraining or measuring changes in the fundamental constants of physics over time, however, we are now at the stage where potential differences in the morphology of the absorbing systems and the background source, combined with their temporal evolution, provide the major source of uncertainty in some systems. Here we present the first milliarcsecond resolution observations of the molecular absorption system towards PKS B1830-211. We have imaged the absorption from the 12.2-GHz transition of methanol (which is redshifted to 6.45 GHz) toward the southwestern component and show that it is possibly offset from the peak of the continuum emission and partially resolved on milliarcsecond scales. Future observations of other methanol transitions with similar angular resolution offer the best prospects for reducing systematic errors in investigations of possible changes in the proton-to-electron mass ratio on cosmological scales. </span>
